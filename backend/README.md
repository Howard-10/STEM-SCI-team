# STEM-SCI backend

This directory contains the Phase 1 Python backend and six specialist-Agent capability framework.

From this directory, install development dependencies with `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"` and run `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, and `pytest`. To enable the optional FAISS + DashScope query path for the declared shared corpus, install `python -m pip install -e ".[hybrid-retrieval]"`; keep `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` only in the local environment.

The six Agents now produce typed, proposal-only research artifacts: planning and design candidates, bounded evidence packages, analysis specifications, claim-safe manuscript candidates, and independent review findings. Agents never approve a protocol, change project stage, mutate data, freeze data, execute code, or create statistical numbers.

The backend includes a narrow deterministic CSV/Python-only demonstration pipeline for data processing, freezing, Controller-owned code specification compilation, hashed code artifacts, static code review, development-restricted code execution, result validation, and result cards. It also contains a fail-closed Codex CLI provider, SPSS syntax/adapter contracts, and cross-engine validation contracts. It does not yet include a production container sandbox, a locally usable Codex CLI integration, a verified IBM SPSS runtime, long-term memory, or a complete Microsoft GraphRAG stack.

The main boundaries are:

- `stem_sci.agents`: six role contracts, structured candidate builders, optional typed GPT rationale, and deterministic safety fallbacks.
- `stem_sci.controller`: routing, approval gates, REWORK, and review-finding feedback.
- `stem_sci.controller.langgraph_workflow`: LangGraph `StateGraph` orchestration with `MemorySaver`, human `interrupt` approval, `Command(resume=...)`, thread checkpoint recovery, six-Agent routing, and explicit result-validation status.
- `stem_sci.context`: project-scoped evidence and ContextBundle assembly.
- `stem_sci.operators`: structured ToolRequest dispatch and explicit unsupported runs.
- `stem_sci.coding`: code-spec compilation, deterministic development template, optional Codex CLI provider, code-review gate, and local restricted sandbox.
- `stem_sci.statistics`: Python execution contracts, SPSS batch adapter/syntax template, single-engine validation, and cross-engine comparison.
- `stem_sci.artifacts` and `stem_sci.provenance`: versioned audit and lineage stores.
- `stem_sci.knowledge`: read-only shared-corpus identity, manifest checks, real BM25 rebuild, optional FAISS query retrieval, and graph-guided candidate navigation. Graph triples are not formal evidence and never contribute a score to RRF.

## Physics-STEM hybrid retrieval

`physics_stem_v1` declares a 122-paper shared corpus, 1,788 local text chunks and a 944-triple paper-level navigation graph. The local assets remain ignored by Git; their hashes are verified against `data/catalogs/physics_stem/physics_stem_v1.manifest.json` before use.

`STEM_SCI_CONTEXT_PROVIDER=local` remains the default. Set it to `hybrid` only on an internal machine with the declared local assets and query-embedding credential. The hybrid provider is fail-closed unless the declared page/character locator index, PDF hashes, and source-verified EvidenceQuotes pass runtime validation. Discovery search may degrade explicitly to local BM25 when FAISS or the embedding dependency is unavailable; it never calls this degraded mode GraphRAG or cross-engine retrieval. The implemented graph capability is deliberately lightweight: it uses model-generated-unverified paper-level triples only to navigate candidate papers, then retrieves original text chunks. It is not community/global search, automatic claim verification, or a substitute for source verification.

For local workflow development only, set `STEM_SCI_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_FORMAL_EVIDENCE=true` to let retrieved shared-corpus chunks pass through the formal workflow while retaining `model_generated_unverified` status and a visible risk flag. Keep it unset or `false` for production; strict configuration rejects this switch.

The workflow literature operators are wired to the shared knowledge service: `literature_search` persists an `EvidenceSet`, `paper_screening` persists a `ScreenedPaperSet`, and `paper_extraction` persists a `PaperCard`. `source_verification` completes only when the corpus has verified locator-backed evidence; otherwise it persists a review-required traceability report and keeps the evidence unverified.

## LangGraph six-Agent workflow

`LangGraphWorkflow` is the executable graph entry point. LangGraph owns node transitions, checkpointed human pauses, and `Command(resume=...)`; `ResearchController` remains responsible for artifact persistence, permissions, approvals, REWORK, and audit. The six-Agent order is `mentor_planning -> evidence_review -> research_design -> data_analysis -> paper_writing -> independent_review`.

```python
from stem_sci.controller import LangGraphWorkflow, PlanningRequest
workflow = LangGraphWorkflow()
state = workflow.start(PlanningRequest(project_id="demo", research_intent="scope"))
state = workflow.resume("demo", decision="approved", decided_by="researcher")
```

The same `thread_id` must be used when resuming. A six-Agent chain ending at `VERIFIED` is reported as `AGENT_CHAIN_COMPLETE_REQUIRES_DATA_VALIDATION` until the Controller-owned data pipeline has a passed validation report and statistical result card.

## Local verification

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m ruff check src tests
python -m mypy src/stem_sci/orchestration
python -m pytest -q -m "not slow"
```

The two full workflow cases are marked `slow` because they exercise the
complete qualitative and quantitative orchestration paths and can take several
minutes on Windows. Run them before release, or run the complete suite when
you need every test:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q -m slow
python -m pytest -q
```

The CI type gate currently checks the Controller-owned orchestration package.
The rest of the backend uses broad JSON payloads and optional scientific
dependencies whose stubs still need a separate typing cleanup; this is tracked
as technical debt rather than hidden behind a blanket ignore.

## GPT configuration

Real GPT calls are opt-in for mentor planning, research design, evidence review, and paper writing. Configure `STEM_SCI_LLM_PROVIDER=gpt`, a GPT-compatible `STEM_SCI_LLM_BASE_URL`, `STEM_SCI_LLM_MODEL`, `STEM_SCI_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, and the per-run `STEM_SCI_MAX_LLM_CALLS` budget. Keep `STEM_SCI_LLM_API_KEY` in the local environment only. Automated tests inject `FakeLLMProvider` and do not access the network.

For an additional argument-level manuscript review, set `STEM_SCI_WRITING_REVIEWER_ENABLED=true`. This adds one bounded structured call after bilingual drafting. The reviewer only returns findings (gap support, causal language, citation support, and discussion boundaries); it cannot edit prose or provenance. The safe default is `false`, and `/api/v1/workflow/runtime` reports the current switch.

## Conversational QA

The user-facing QA chain is exposed separately from the six-agent workflow:

```text
POST /api/v1/qa/answer
```

It performs transparent query expansion, graph-guided hybrid retrieval, `ContextBundle`
assembly, optional GPT-compatible answer synthesis, citations, and SQLite conversation
memory. When an LLM key is configured, the router can use bounded function calls for
`graph_search`, `vector_search`, `hybrid_search`, `paper_lookup`, `workflow_agent`, and
`external_paper_search`, then synthesize a final answer from the returned tool results.
Without an LLM key it returns a deterministic evidence summary and keeps the same
retrieval/memory trace. `workflow_agent` is proposal-only and cannot mutate workflow state.

When the local corpus is insufficient, the conversational router may call the bounded
`external_paper_search` tool. Set `STEM_SCI_EXTERNAL_SEARCH_PROVIDER=openalex` (or
`crossref`/`auto`) to enable it; no API key is required for these bibliographic APIs.
External results contain metadata such as title, DOI, year, and landing-page URL. The
service stores them in the project discovery database and may import an explicitly
public PDF into the project source store; imported files remain
`model_generated_unverified`. They are not formal evidence until the original source
has been checked and its page or character location verified.

The response includes `tool_calls` so the frontend can show which retrieval path was
selected without exposing provider credentials or internal database connections.

For DeepSeek-compatible chat completions, set:

```text
STEM_SCI_LLM_PROVIDER=gpt
STEM_SCI_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
STEM_SCI_LLM_MODEL=deepseek-chat
STEM_SCI_LLM_API_KEY=<local-secret>
STEM_SCI_LLM_RESPONSE_FORMAT=auto
```

The vector query side still uses `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and the declared
`text-embedding-v3` corpus index. Set both keys only in the local shell or an ignored
`.env.local`; never commit them.

When the vector files and PDFs are stored outside the repository, point the backend at
them without copying them into Git:

```text
STEM_SCI_VECTOR_KB_ROOT=C:\path\to\vector_kb
STEM_SCI_PDF_ROOT=C:\path\to\literature_pdfs
```

To rebuild the page/character locator after replacing the local PDF batch, run this
from the repository root. The command updates only traceability metadata and the
manifest hash; it never copies PDF files into Git:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e "backend[hybrid-retrieval]"
$env:STEM_SCI_VECTOR_KB_ROOT="C:\path\to\vector_kb"
python backend/scripts/build_physics_stem_locator.py `
  --pdf-root "C:\path\to\literature_pdfs" `
  --update-manifest
```

The locator keeps exact whitespace-normalized matches as `source_verified`.
Aggressively normalized matches remain `model_generated_unverified` until a person
checks the original PDF, so they are excluded from formal evidence.

To use the imported Neo4j sparse graph instead of the JSON graph artifact:

```text
STEM_SCI_GRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7688
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<local-neo4j-password>
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
NEO4J_PROJECT_ID=stem-sci
```

`STEM_SCI_GRAPH_BACKEND=auto` is the default. It tries Neo4j when configured and
falls back to the checked-in JSON graph when Neo4j is unavailable. Use `neo4j` when
you want a failed connection to be visible instead of silently degrading.

## Research-code execution configuration

The API loads the repository root `.env` (and `.env.local`) before constructing
the Controller, so these settings also apply when uvicorn is started from
`backend`. `STEM_SCI_CODEX_COMMAND` defaults to `codex`. `STEM_SCI_CODING_PROVIDER` defaults to
`deterministic`; set it to `codex` only after a locally executable and authenticated
Codex CLI is available. The Codex provider uses non-interactive read-only generation
and accepts only a schema/plan specification, never the frozen-data rows. Its output
remains a candidate until CodeReviewGate and human approval allow it to execute.

Set `STEM_SCI_SPSS_EXECUTABLE` to the licensed IBM SPSS Statistics batch executable when it is available. A `SPSS_PYTHON_DUAL` data-pipeline run now invokes Python and the SPSS adapter and compares their normalized outputs. Without SPSS, the adapter reports a blocked SPSS Run; it never silently downgrades to Python-only. A Python-only result remains `SINGLE_ENGINE` and cannot be represented as cross-engine verified. The read-only `/api/v1/workflow/runtime` endpoint reports provider availability without exposing executable paths. See `docs/reports/RESEARCH_EXECUTION_MVP_STATUS.md` for the current execution evidence and development-sandbox limitations.
